ABSOLUTE RULE: No local command execution whatsoever
- No npm, tsc, git, or any terminal commands
- Cloud-only workflow: make changes → commit → push → let CI validate
- Never run typecheck, build, test, or any local validation commands

Clearly state what action is needed
Provide detailed step-by-step instructions
Include specific values, URLs, or settings
Explain the expected outcome
Provide troubleshooting if the action fails
